\ntheir language and incessantly drawing attention to them \nand their appalling condition. Get off the backs of these \npeasants and workers, he told us, all you who live by \ntheir exploitation; get rid of the system that produces \nthis poverty and misery. Political freedom took new \nshape then and that produces this poverty and misery. \nPolitical freedom took new shape then and acquired a new content. Much that \nhe said we only partially accepted or some times did not accept at all. But all \nthis was secondary. The essence of his teaching was fearlessness and truth and \naction allied to 6these, always keeping the welfare of the masses in view. The \ngreatest gift for an individual or a nation, so we had been told in our ancient \nbooks, was abhaya, fearlessness, not merely bodily courage but the absence of \nfear from the mind. Janaka and Yajnavalkya had said, at the dawn of our \nhistory, that it was the function of the leaders of a people to make them \nfearless. But the dominant impulse in India under British rule was that of fear, \npervasive, oppressing, strangling fear; fear of the army, the police, the wide-\nspread secret service; fear of the official class; fear of the laws meant to \nsuppress and of prison; fear of the landlord's agent; fear of the money lender; \nfear of unemployment and starvation, which were always on the threshold. It \nwas against this all-pervading fear that Gandhi's quite and determined voice \nwas raised; be not afraid. Was it so simple as all that? Not quite. And yet fear \nbuilds its phantoms which are more fearsome than reality itself, and reality, \nwhen calmly analysed and its consequences willingly accepted, loses much of \nits terror. \nSo, suddenly as at were, that black pall of fear was lifted from the people's \nshoulders, not wholly of course, but to an amazing degree. \nJawaharlal Nehru  \n(The Discovery of India)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2055, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd40c56a-7fe3-46c4-a281-66fdef7f155e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd40c56a-7fe3-46c4-a281-66fdef7f155e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "The Story of Gandhi.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\NLP-Embedding\\Data\\The Story of Gandhi.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5149356, "creation_date": "2024-08-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2ff2758-f166-4aeb-993f-ff16f9b83c89", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "The Story of Gandhi.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\Ai\\OneDrive\\Programm\\GitHub\\NLP-Embedding\\Data\\The Story of Gandhi.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5149356, "creation_date": "2024-08-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-14"}, "hash": "9393f8e718c2ecf43fc083fb04d334c07e23b82af43c3cda0782db5fa3448b93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Story of Gandhi \n \nwww.mkgandhi.org   Page 3  \n01. BIRTH & CHILDHOOD \nIn a small, white-washed house in Porbandar, on the c oast of Kathiawad in \nwestern India, Mohandas Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869. His parents were \nKaramchand Gandhi and Putlibai. He was small and dark, and looked no \ndifferent from the millions of other children born in India. Yet this was no \nordinary child. He was to fight and overcome a great empire and, without \ntaking to arms, set his country free. He was to be called the Mahatma, the \nGreat Soul. Having led his people to freedom, he was to lay down his life for \ntheir sake. \nPorbandar is an old sea-port, overlooked by the distant Barda Hills. Even in \nancient days ships from far off lands went there to trade. It was the ancestral \nhome of the Gandhi's. The grandfather and father of Mohandas were famous for \ntheir ability and for their upright character. \nGrandfather Uttamchand Gandhi, who belonged to a humble family of \nmerchants, become the Dewan of Porbandar. He was succeeded by his son, \nKaramchand Gandhi popularly known as a Kaba Gandhi. Karamchand had very \nlittle formal education, but his knowledge and experience made him a good \nadministrator. He was brave and generous. He had, however, one fault a bad \ntemper. \nPutlibai, Karamchand Gandhi's wife, was deeply religious. Every day she \nworshipped at the temple. She was a lovable and strong willed woman, widely \nrespected for her wisdom and good sense. People often sought her advice on \nvarious matters. \nMohandas was the youngest of the six children of Kaba Gandhi.

INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS \nOn his arrival in India, Gandhi went on a tour of the  country. The annual \nmeeting of the Indian National Congress was being held in Calcutta under the \npresident ship of Dinshaw Wacha. Gandhi attended the session. It was his first \ncontact with the Congress which he was to lead so gloriously in the future. \nThe Indian National Congress was the only organization which gave the people \nof India a chance to express their political views. It was an influential body as \nmany important Indians were members, but its decisions had little effect on the \nGovernment. \nAt the Calcutta session in 1901 Gandhi had an opportunity to meet Congress \nLeaders like Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, Lokmanya B. G. Tilak, G. k. Gokhale, and \nothers. \nHe was not impressed with the way the Congress was functioning. He noticed a \nlack of unity among the delegates. Moreover, while they spoke English and \naffected the style of westerners in their dress and talk, they did not seem to \nbother about essential things like good sanitary facilities in the camp. Gandhi \nwanted to teach them a lesson. On his own he quietly started cleaning the \nbathroom and latrine. No one volunteered to join him. \n'Why do you undertake an untouchable's job?' they asked. \n'Because the caste people have made this an untouchable place,' replied \nGandhi. \nFrom Calcutta Gandhi traveled round India by train. As he moved from place to \nplace, he was shocked to see the life of the common people the famished \nignorant and neglected masses. His heart was filled with sadness and anger. \nGandhi settled down in Bombay and started practice as a lawyer. He did well, \nmuch better than he had expected. In December 1902, however, a cable \nreached him from South Africa requesting him to return as promised.

From Natal, Mr. Chamberlain proceeded to the \nTransvaal. The Indians there also wanted Gandhi to present their grievances to \nhim. \nBefore the Boer war, Indians had been free to enter Transvaal at any time, but \nnow they had to obtain a permit from the newly created Asiatic Department. \nThe new rule was designed to separate Indians from the whites. To get a permit \nwas no easy matter. \nThe officers of the Asiatic Department did their best to prevent Gandhi from \nentering the Transvaal but he had his way in the end. He got a permit and went \nto Pretoria. He was not allowed, however, to lead a deputation and present the \nmemorandum he had drafted. Gandhi now decided to stay in the Transvaal and \nfight the colour bar which was taking such ugly shape there. He realized that \nnow he would not be able to leave the country, as he had hoped to do.

There is no salvation for India \nunless you strip yourselves of this jewellery and hold it in trust for your country \nmen in India.\u2019 \nGandhi gave a long speech, covering many topics. His speech was full of \noutspoken criticism. \nMrs. Annie Besant, who was one of the organizers of the function, was horrified \nand urged Gandhi to sit down. But Gandhi went on.

CHAMPARAN SATYAGRAHA \nNow Gandhi heard about an obnoxious system of agricul tural labour prevailing \nin Bihar. \nIn the Champaran district of Bihar, the cultivators were forced by Europeans to \ngrow indigo, a blue dye, and this imposed on them untold sufferings. They \ncould not grow the food they needed, nor did they receive adequate payment \nfor the indigo. \nGandhi was unaware of this until an agriculturist from Bihar, Rajkumar Shukla, \nmet him and told him of the woes of the people of Champaran.

It had spread there from \nAhmedabad. \nA rich merchant of Ahmedabad, who was closely associated with the ashrama, \nvolunteered to procure a suitable piece of land.

Prices had gone up and the mill \nworkers were demanding higher wages. The mill owners would not agree. \nGandhi sympathized with the workers and took up their cause. He launched a \nstruggle and resorted to peaceful resistance. The workers proudly followed \nGandhi and pledged their full support to him. They paraded the streets with \nlarge banners, and said they would not go back to work until a settlement had \nbeen reached. \nDays passed. The mill owners were adamant. The strikers were getting \nimpatient for they were faced with starvation. Their discipline became weak. \nGandhi feared that some workers would break their pledge and go back to \nwork. That would be a great moral defeat. \nOne morning he called the workers and said, \u2018Unless the strikers rally and \ncontinue the strike till a settlement is reached.

Civil disobedience would begin by breaking \nthe salt law. 'Salt suddenly became a mysterious word, a word of power,' Nehru \nsaid. \nThe Government had put an excise tax on salt which brought an enormous \namount of money to the treasury. Moreover, the Government had the monopoly \nof manufacturing salt. \nThe salt tax was to be attacked and salt laws were to be broken. The very \nsimplicity of Gandhi's choice made the issue more dramatic. \nOn March 2, 1930, Gandhi wrote a long letter to the new Viceroy, Lord Irwin, \nabout the deplorable condition of India under British rule. \nBritish rule', he said, 'has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of \nprogressive exploitation, and by ruinously expensive military and civil \nadministration which the country can never afford.

SEVAGRAM \nAt home Gandhi found that the Government \nha\nd returned to the policy of repression. \nThere were widespread arrests and the \nGovernment seized the properties and bank \nbalances of people and organizations who \nwere hostile to their interests. \nEarly in 1932 Gandhi wanted to meet the \nnew Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, but the \nViceroy made it clear that the days of negotiation were over. \nGandhi informed the authorities that he was again starting a civil disobedience \ncampaign.

It was an attempt to weaken Hindu society. \n'Separate treatment of untouchables cannot be allowed,' declared Gandhi. \n'Here is an attempt to make unsociability last forever.
